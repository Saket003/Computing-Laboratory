Even though some questions ask you to solve the equations using one particular method, or some methods might not be in the sheets, please practice all the methods done in the class. For example, in this sheet, if a question asks to solve the system using the Jacobi method, then please also do it for Guass-Siedel etc as well. Practice sheets are indicative and are not meant to be exhaustive.
